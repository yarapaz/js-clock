![Js Clock Preview](./docs/assets/images/js-clock-preview.jpg)

Welcome to the JS Clock project! This project aim was to build a fully operative clock just by using **HTML, CSS (developed using Sass), JavaScript and Gulp.**

The clock matches the official time of your country and shows you the time with accuracy.
